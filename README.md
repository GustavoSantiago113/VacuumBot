# VacuumBot
> A DIY vacuum bot made to clean my house

# Objective

The objective of this project is to build a DIY Vacuum robot to clean my appartment and, of course, sharp my skills. If you know me, I like to make things instead of buying them just because.

# Specifications

* Run through all my appartment using a single battery charge.
* Be able to go through carpet and floor.
* Have a central to unload the dirt and recharge.
* Use sensors and push buttons to detect objects and communicate with the central.
