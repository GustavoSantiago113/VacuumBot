# VacuumBot
> A DIY vacuum bot made to clean my house

# Objective

The objective of this project is to build a DIY Vacuum robot to clean my appartment and, of course, sharp my skills. If you know me, I like to make things instead of buying them just because.

# Specifications

* Run through all my appartment using a single battery charge.
* Be able to go through carpet and floor.
* Have a central to unload the dirt and recharge.
* Use sensors and push buttons to detect objects.
* At the first time, maps the place using cameras or sensors.
* Communicate with the central using radio.
* After the place is mapped, the central corrects the path using RTK.
* Have an app to monitor, start/end cleaning, and define if is using the pre-determined path or new one.
